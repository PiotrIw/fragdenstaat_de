# Optimize font for web

We are using the font Inter by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/) licensed under the [SIL OpenFont License 1.1](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/ofl-1.1/).

This script build it for our needs. Do this:

1. Create a Python3 virtualenv and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. [Download the font](https://rsms.me/inter/) and extract it, possibly adjust path in script
3. Run script which will create subsets by unicode range in woff/woff2.
